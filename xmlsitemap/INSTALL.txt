XML Sitemap Module

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

1) Place the xmlsitemap directory into your modules directory.

2) Enable the XML sitemap modules you wish to use.
   You must enable the XML sitemap engines module if you want to automatically
   submit your sitemap to search engines.

3) You can configure settings for the XML sitemap module at
   admin/settings/xmlsitemap.  Settings for specific links are available
   within those links edit forms.

4) For existing data to become presented in the sitemap report you must
   execute cron.php.  There are control settings at admin/settings/xmlsitemap
   for the number of rows to execute in one cron 240 second execution.
   Take note that all the module tasks executed at cron time share the
   same 240 seconds execution; if you are not seeing data populated you
   should increase the number of times in the day cron.php executes.
